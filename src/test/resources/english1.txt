Imagine
John Lennon

Imagine there's no heeven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagie all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dremaer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the wrold will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hungar
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the poople sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
